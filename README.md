# Shopping-Spree

## Description

My motivation for this project was wanting to touch up my skills working with back end code and API's.
I built this application because it was also good practice for working with pre-made front end code and collaborating with other programmers.
This website can help small business owners wanting to make a simple webapp for their store while also being easy to adjust for anyone who attempts to touch it up in the future.
I learned new ways to work with routes and models.
